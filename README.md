## To-do
- [x] fix renderRemaining() function
- [x] change workout-type to something else (type of workout? push? upper body? cardio? recovery?)
- [x] add timed workout functionality (warm up, plank, jog, etc.)
- [x] Add some exercises templates
- [x] Add few more workout templates
- [x] Add some basic/general muscle groups
- [ ] ~~Add Workout Program Feature (but I don't know what is program yet) (might not be needed for simple and streamlined system)~~
- [x] change order of input fields to be more user-friendly
- [x] fix chart logic in workout routine
- [x] fix chart on exercise, x-axis should be time and date, not just date.
- [ ] ~~add relation between equipment and place for better exercises selection~~
- [ ] add muscle-group or exercises dashboard
- [ ] add demo video
- [ ] if possible, add full body visualization of each exercises done and soreness/muscle area (simulate rest periods and recovery)
- [ ] hide properties is default on notes inside workouts folder
- [ ] fix timer and add stopwatch feature
- [ ] should i change muscle group selections to multiple select? (require much more time for user to add themselves, kind of bad ux)

Now it is fully usable, might not need relation equipment and place (adding new relational data is time-consuming so.. no). Will do hide properties, musclegroup/exercises dashboard, demo video, and if possible add full body visualization.

Workout program not needed as is just meant for simple logging/tracking system.
